# Platzi Web3 Exercise

## Goal
Create a DApp that works with Ethers.js and Web3.js, making every functionality with both libraries, it must:
Allow to interact with a Smart Contract, listen events, listen for account change,listen for chain change. Update in real time the data every time the Smart Contract is interacted. 

## Result
###Functionalities made: 
Votes with Smart Contract defined fee, applied good transaction UX.
Listening for Vote Event and updating data.
Listening for "accountChange" and update user data.
Listening for "chainChange", and showing switch to correct chain ( Goerli ) on UI.

Every function was made in both Web3.js and Ethers.js versions, and the user can pick which one to apply.


## Stack and tools

Next.js, Ethers.js, Web3.js, SwiperJS, react switch.

Demo: https://web3-library-duality.vercel.app/

It was a truly good experience to compare the working logic of the two libraries. Definetly Ethers.js is the winner.
